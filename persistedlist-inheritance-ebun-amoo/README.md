## PersistedList Reset (Inheritance)

* Please edit main.py
* Create a child class of the `PersistedList` class called `PersistedListWithReset`.
* Add a method on that child class called `reset`. It should set the internal list to `[]` (an empty list).
* Write a few lines of code at the end of the file that:
  * Create an instance of PersistedListWithReset
  * Add to the list by calling the append method
  * Call the new `reset` method
